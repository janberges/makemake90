*makemake90* is a Python script that generates Makefiles for modular Fortran
programs. It recursively searches the working directory for *.f90* files and
determines their dependencies. The file *Makefile* will be created. If this
file already exists, all content up to the first occurrence of *generated by
makemake* will be left untouched. Using the command-line arguments *src=...*,
*obj=...*, *mod=...*, and *bin=...*, it is possible to search source files and
store compiled object, module, and executable files in different directories.
